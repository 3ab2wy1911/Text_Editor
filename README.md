## The idea of the Program
* It's  a Text Editor program that displays a menu with the list of options show in the table below. At the start:

1- **The user enters the name of the file he wants to deal with.**

2- **The program will test if such a file exists or not. If it does, it will display a message: "This File Already Exists" and it will open it for read and write. If it does not exist, it will create a file with the given name and will print a message: "This is a new file. I created it for you."**

3- **After that the following menu will be displayed. The user chooses an option to apply and after executing it, the program re-displays the menu till Exit is chosen.**
